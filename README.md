FEASTA is developed by six members of the SWEET team for their Software Engineering course at St. John's University in Spring 2018. Once the app is made available, users are free and welcome to use the app. Feedback and issue reporting from both developers and users is welcome. However, as part of the academic integrity, copying or reusing the code of this project without proper citation is not allowed and may result in your own risks of violating academic institution regulations. 

While SWEET makes our best effort to ensure the app works correctly and properly, use this app at your own risk. Your use of this app implies you hold SWEET of no liability for any damage or benefits caused.

* Learned/Notice:
 * Kotlin vs. Java: [source](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3224868/java/what-is-kotlin-the-java-alternative-explained.html "InfoWorld Oct 2017 article")
   * For complete Android dev newbies: Java might be better becauses there are more documentation and examples written in Java. However, converting Java to Kotlin is as simple as pasting the Java code into a Koitlin file.
   * For most other Android developers: Kotlin code is safe and more concise than Java code; **Kotlin and Java files can coexist in an Android app**; you can expand existing Java apps using Kotlin.
* Next steps:
 * Continue watching the last 4 videos
 * Continue reading the [Android App Fundamentals](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals.html) page
