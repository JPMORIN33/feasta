# Design Phase
## Artifacts
- Textual description of classes and key methods
- Diagrams of class relationships (dependency "uses", aggregation "has", inheritance "is")
- Diagrams of important usage scenarios
- State diagrams for objects with rich state

Based on your phase I report, please:
1. Identify potential classes for your project;
2. For each class, identify potential responsibilities/behaviors/methods;
3. Identify the relationships among different classes

You will also need to work on three UML diagrams:
1. State Chart Diagram
2. Sequence Diagram
3. Use-case Diagram

What you need to turn in:
1. Revised Phase I report
2. The Phase II report

(Thoa) I think our Phase 2 Report will include:
  * A pdf version of the Classes and Methods word doc.
  * Diagrams:
    * classes-and-relationships
    * use case
    * statechart
    * sequence
  * Neel's software architecture
  * Contributions by member
