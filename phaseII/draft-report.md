# Design Phase
## Artifacts
- Textual description of classes and key methods
- Diagrams of class relationships (dependency "uses", aggregation "has", inheritance "is")
- Diagrams of important usage scenarios
- State diagrams for objects with rich state

Based on your phase I report, please:
1. Identify potential classes for your project;
2. For each class, identify potential responsibilities/behaviors/methods;
3. Identify the relationships among different classes
You will also need to work on three UML diagrams:
1. State Chart Diagram
2. Sequence Diagram
3. Use-case Diagram
What you need to turn in:
1. Revised Phase I report
2. The Phase II report
