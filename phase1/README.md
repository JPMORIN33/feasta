# Phase 1: Requirement Analysis

Guide to read this folder:

**Assignment1.pdf**: critical review of 3 similar software.

**C-Requirements.md**: a draft of all user-level features (saved-for-later features are listed at the bottom).

**Presentation.pdf**: a info-dense ppt version of our Phase I Report (note: Phase I Report does not exist in this folder as it's under constant revisions).

**ProjectDescription.pdf**: a pitch-style ppt used at our Project Proposal Presentation Day.

**ProjectProposal.pdf**: our very first documentation of this project - just a short and simple overview of what we intend to build this semester.

**SystemFeatures.md**: a comprehensive list of developer-level features; each feature has a short description, stimulus and response sequence(s) (read: data flows), and associated functional requirements. Theoretically, we will judge our app off these functional requirements to see if it delivers all the points it claims to deliver.
